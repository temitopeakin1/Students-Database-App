# Students-Database-App
I developed this simple database admin app using Java
The following features were taking into consideration
- Name of student
- level
- Students ID genration
- Courses offered
- Adjusting cost per course
- Amount paid or deposited
- View students status

Application still in Work in progress
I intend to add features like 
- Database Integration using PostgreSQl or MongoDb
- Create a method to show if two Students have the same status, Avoid duplication of data

You can view the Working App by using your Preferred IDE (NetBeans, Eclipse, Intellij IDEA) and running App
